# treereduce

`treereduce` is a fast, parallel, syntax-aware, multi-language program reducer
based on delta debugging and tree-sitter grammars. In other words, `treereduce`
helps you shrink programs while maintaining some property of interest, for
example, that the program causes a compiler crash or outputs a certain message.

See the {doc}`overview` for more information, or get started right away with
{doc}`install` and {doc}`usage`.

Source available [on Github][src].

```{warning}
`treereduce` is **alpha-quality** software. Some parts of the documentation are
currently aspirational---these are marked with TODOs and linked issues.
