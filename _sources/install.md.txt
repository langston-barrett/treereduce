# Installation

## From a Release

Statically-linked Linux binaries are available on the [releases page][releases].

## From crates.io

You can build a released version from [crates.io][crates-io]. You'll need the
Rust compiler and the [Cargo][cargo] build tool. [rustup][rustup] makes it very
easy to obtain these. Then, to install the reducer for the language `<LANG>`,
run:

```
cargo install treereduce-<LANG>
```

This will install binaries in `~/.cargo/bin` by default.

## From Source

You can also {doc}`build from source <build>`.
