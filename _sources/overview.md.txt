# Overview

## Features

- **Fast**: `treereduce` uses a {doc}`novel algorithm <design>` for parallelized
  reduction of tree-shaped data, based on ideas from {ref}`recent research
  <bib>`. It is written in Rust and has been {doc}`extensively benchmarked
  <benchmarks>`.
- **Effective**: `treereduce` produces {doc}`small programs <benchmarks>`.
- **Robust**: `treereduce` is based on tree-sitter grammars, which are robust to
  parse errors. This means you can reduce syntactically invalid inputs, and
  each grammar doesn't need to be 100% perfect to work for all programs.
- **Easy to set up**: `treereduce` reducers are distributed as static binaries.
- **Multi-language**: `treereduce` currently supports the following languages:

  * C
