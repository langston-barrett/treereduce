# Usage

`treereduce` needs a *testcase* and an *interestingness test*.  The test
case can be provided on stdin or via a file with `--source` (`-s`). The
interestingness test is an executable (or script) that exits with 0 if the test
is still interesting, or with any other code otherwise. The interestingness
test is provided on the `treereduce` command line after a `--`. It can either
receive the partially-reduced program on stdin, or via a file provided as
command-line argument. In the latter case, the special symbol `@@` in the
command line tells `treereduce` how to provide the file path. For example,
here's how to reduce a C program while making sure it still compiles with
`clang`:

```sh
treereduce-c --output program-reduced.c -s program.c -- clang -o /dev/null @@.c
```

See `--help` for more information.
