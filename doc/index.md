# treereduce

`treereduce` is a fast, parallel, syntax-aware test case reducer based on
tree-sitter grammars. In other words, `treereduce` helps you shrink structured
data (especially source code) while maintaining some property of interest, for
example, that the program causes a compiler crash or outputs a certain message.

See the [overview](overview.md) for more information, or get started right away with
[installation](install.md) and [usage](usage.md).
